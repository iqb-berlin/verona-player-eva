# IQB Verona Player Eva 
Verona interfaces are specifications concerning computer based assessment. You can learn 
more about this German initiative [here](https://github.com/verona-interfaces/introduction).

IQB`s verona-player-eva is a software component which runs unit definitions inside verona 
compliant web applications. The main target for this player are surveys. Unit 
definitions are written as simple text scripts. You can find the specifications of the unit definitions
for this player [here](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/verona-data-specifications/blob/main/unit-defs/manual_iqb-scripted.md).
The responses this player emits are specified [here](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/verona-data-specifications/blob/main/responses/manual_iqb-key-value.md).
 
## Using the Player
* You need a Verona host system to run this software, for example the 
[IQB-Testcenter](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/testcenter-setup) or the 
[Verona-Player-Testbed](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/verona-player-testbed).
* This angular application builds to one single html file. See the 
[release section](https://github.com/iqb-berlin/verona-player-eva/releases) of
this repository to get a ready-to-use player.
